# User Study Results

We conducted a user study on the effectiveness of our adaptive training. We
divided our subjects into two cohorts. The first cohort trained using our
adaptive system, and then trained on their own, and the second cohort reversed
the order. Before and after each training period, we measured the subject's
ability to hit randomized pitches. This way, we could compare the improvement
through the adaptive training versus self-guided training.

Ultimately, we found that both types of training produced improvement, we were
unable to distinguish the two types of training in our dataset.
