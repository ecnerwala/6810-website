Hitting a pitch in baseball is a tricky task that requires hand-eye coordination
and much training. We built a pitching machine that helps users train their
hand-eye coordination by throwing pitches with different parameters, including
speed and angle, forcing users to stay on their toes. When our system detects
that users become more experienced, it increases the amount of variation in the
pitches, and when it detects users are struggling, it decreases the amount of
variation and potentially decreases the speed of the pitch.
